# Part 1 of the first assignment

1. I created 2 classes , one person and one secretary.Each class has a cpp and a header file.
2. Also there is a main file ass asked.
3. All questions asked are implemented in the code.
4. In operator+ i create a new array , copy the already existing data , destroy the old and copy the new to the department array which is the array of the Secretary class. There is a better way of implementing this , using vectors so that i dont duplicate the array with every entry of a Person in the Secretary class.
5. I also created a make file with the following commands:
    a. make , to compile.
    b. make run , to run.
    c. make clean , to clean extra files.
6. Only difficulty i encountered was understanding how to use oparators.
